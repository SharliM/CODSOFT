# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about passengers and their survival status. The prediction is based on features such as passenger class, gender, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, and number of parents/children aboard.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the required dependencies:
4. Place the dataset file `kaggle.csv` in the project directory.

5. Run the main script:

## Files
- `titanic_prediction.py`: The main Python script for data preprocessing, model training, prediction, evaluation, and visualization.
- `kaggle.csv`: Dataset file containing Titanic passenger information.
- `predictions.csv`: Output file containing the predictions.

## Results
- The script generates predictions for survival on the Titanic based on the provided dataset.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are displayed.
- Visualizations including bar plots and pie charts are provided to illustrate the distribution of predicted survivors by gender.
